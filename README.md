Creative Portion:
For the creative portion, we implemented a renaming featre for the file sharing website. After choosing the file you want to rename, rename the file WITHOUT the file extension in the name. The file rename feature renames the file in the user directory as well, not just on the web server.
(I.E. if you want to rename hi.txt-->hello.txt, you would rename hi.txt to hello. The .txt will be added automatically)

Instructions:
Log in with one of the users provided above. Choose file that you want to upload and then hit "upload" button. Using php, we created a radio option list of files which we got inspiration from my(Ryan's) calculator website. Hit one of the buttons "open", "delete", or "rename" to perform the action on the file. Press "Logout" to be redirected to login screen and destroy a session.
